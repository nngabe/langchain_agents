      " X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit WASHINGTON (AP) — With talks to reopen the government intensifying, Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Thursday expressed determination to move ahead with a new bipartisan package of funding bills, a renewed effort to win over enough Democrats and end the shutdown that is now in its 37th day. It was unclear if the move could force a resolution. Senate Democrats, who have now voted 14 times not to reopen the government, left their second caucus meeting of the week with few answers about how to proceed and whether they could find a compromise with Republicans — or even with each other — on how to end the shutdown. Some Democrats say the fight isn’t over until Republicans and President Donald Trump agree to extend health care subsidies that expire in January. Others are pushing a deal that would reopen the government with only an agreement for a future vote on the issue. “Working on unity and working on health care,” Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island said after the meeting. Still, lawmakers in both parties were feeling increased urgency to alleviate the growing crisis at airports, pay government workers and restore delayed food aid to millions of people now that the shutdown has become the longest in U.S. history.

       "'X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit WASHINGTON (AP) — Talks intensified Tuesday toward a potential end to the government shutdown, as the federal closure was on track to become the longest ever, disrupting the lives of millions of Americans. But tensions also rose as senators from both parties, Republicans and Democrats, quietly negotiated the contours of an emerging deal. With a nod from their leadership, the senators are seeking a way to reopen the government, put the normal federal funding process back on track and devise some sort of resolution for expiring health insurance subsidies that are spiking premium costs from coast to coast.“Enough is enough,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, the South Dakota Republican, as he opened the deadlocked chamber. On day 35 of the federal government shutdown, the record for the longest will be broken after midnight. SNAP benefits have been interrupted for millions of Americans depending on federal food aid and hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been furloughed or are working without pay. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy predicted there could be chaos in the skies next week if air traffic controllers miss another paycheck. Labor unions put pressure on lawmakers to reopen the government.

Another test vote Tuesday in the Senate failed, as Democrats rejected a temporary government funding bill.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Now into a sixth week, the shutdown and its impacts have deepened nationwide. The federal closures are disrupting the lives of millions of Americans with program cuts, flight delays and workers scrambling to make do without paychecks. Officials have warned of a worsening climate to come, including chaos in the skies. The Federal Aviation Administration said it will reduce air traffic starting Friday in major markets.\\n\\nGovernment shutdownThe AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them? Expectations were high that the logjam would break once results were tallied in elections that were widely watched as a gauge of voter sentiment over Trump’s second term. But Trump’s demands on Wednesday that Republican senators get rid of the filibuster as a way to end the shutdown complicated an already difficult situation. And Democrats facing divisions within their progressive and moderate ranks said the results showed that voters will reward them for the fight. “It’s time for Republicans to do what they have to do, and that’s terminate the filibuster,” Trump said during a breakfast meeting Wednesday with GOP senators at the White House. Trump told the GOP senators they could bring the shutdown to a close by ending the Senate rule, which requires a 60-vote threshold for advancing most legislation, and steamroll the Democratic minority. Republicans now hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, and Democrats have been able to block legislation that would fund the government, having voted more than a dozen times against.That push from Trump is likely to go unheeded by Republican senators — Senate Majority Leader John Thune said later changing the filibuster does not'"

      "X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit WASHINGTON (AP) — Talks intensified Tuesday toward a potential end to the government shutdown, as the federal closure was on track to become the longest ever, disrupting the lives of millions of Americans. But tensions also rose as senators from both parties, Republicans and Democrats, quietly negotiated the contours of an emerging deal. With a nod from their leadership, the senators are seeking a way to reopen the government, put the normal federal funding process back on track and devise some sort of resolution for expiring health insurance subsidies that are spiking premium costs from coast to coast.“Enough is enough,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, the South Dakota Republican, as he opened the deadlocked chamber. On day 35 of the federal government shutdown, the record for the longest will be broken after midnight. SNAP benefits have been interrupted for millions of Americans depending on federal food aid and hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been furloughed or are working without pay. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy predicted there could be chaos in the skies next week if air traffic controllers miss another paycheck. Labor unions put pressure on lawmakers to reopen the government. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticizes Republicans for their healthcare\n",
      "\n",
      "contours of an agreement began to emerge. The agreement includes bipartisan bills worked out by the Senate Appropriations Committee to fund parts of government — food aid, veterans programs and the legislative branch, among other things. All other funding would be extended until the end of January, giving lawmakers more than two months to finish additional spending bills. The deal would reinstate federal workers who had received reduction in force, or layoff, notices and reimburse states that spent their own funds to keep federal programs running during the shutdown. It would also protect against future reductions in force through January and guarantee federal workers would be paid once the shutdown is over.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) House Democrats push back House Democrats swiftly criticized the Senate. Texas Rep. Greg Casar, the chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said a deal that doesn’t reduce health care costs is a “betrayal” of millions of Americans who are counting on Democrats to fight. “Accepting nothing but a pinky promise from Republicans isn’t a compromise — it’s\n",

      "Government shutdownThe AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them? Expectations were high that the logjam would break once results were tallied in elections that were widely watched as a gauge of voter sentiment over Trump’s second term. But Trump’s demands on Wednesday that Republican senators get rid of the filibuster as a way to end the shutdown complicated an already difficult situation. And Democrats facing divisions within their progressive and moderate ranks said the results showed that voters will reward them for the fight. “It’s time for Republicans to do what they have to do, and that’s terminate the filibuster,” Trump said during a breakfast meeting Wednesday with GOP senators at the White House. Trump told the GOP senators they could bring the shutdown to a close by ending the Senate rule, which requires a 60-vote threshold for advancing most legislation, and steamroll the Democratic minority. Republicans now hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, and Democrats have been able to block legislation that would fund the government, having voted more than a dozen times against.That push from Trump is likely to go unheeded by Republican senators — Senate Majority Leader John Thune said later changing the filibuster does not\n",

      "they also want new limits on who can receive the subsidies and argue that the tax dollars for the plans should be routed through individuals. Other Republicans, including Trump, have used the debate to renew their yearslong criticism of the law and called for it to be scrapped or overhauled. Shutdown effects worsen Meanwhile, the consequences of the shutdown have been compounding. U.S. airlines canceled more than 2,000 flights on Sunday for the first time since the shutdown began, and there were more than 7,000 flight delays, according to FlightAware, a website that tracks air travel disruptions.Treasury Secretary Sean Duffy said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that air travel ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday will be “reduced to a trickle” if the government doesn’t reopen.

      "X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit NEW YORK (AP) — Big Tech and other superstars of the U.S. stock market got back to rallying on Monday, and Wall Street recovered most of its loss from last week.The S&P 500 climbed 1.5% and clawed back nearly all its drop from last week, which was its first weekly loss in four. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 381 points, or 0.8%, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 2.3% for its best day since May. Nvidia was by far the strongest force lifting the market and leaped 5.8%. It was a powerful rebound after Nvidia and other winners of the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology led last week’s drop. Critics say their stock prices shot too high and too fast in the AI mania, drawing comparisons to the 2000 dot-com bubble that ultimately burst.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips for Nvidia and other companies, saw its stock that trades in United States rise 3.1% after reporting that its revenue climbed nearly 17% in October from a year earlier.

Its bigger rival, Samsung Electronics, climbed 2.8%.

      "Elsewhere on Wall Street, Berkshire Hathaway slipped 0.4% as its CEO, famed investor Warren Buffett, warned shareholders that many other companies will fare better in the decades ahead because of Berkshire Hathaway’s massive size. Buffett, 95, is set to step down in January. Tyson Foods climbed 2.3% after the seller of chicken, beef and pork reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.Roughly four out of every five companies in the S&P 500 that have so far reported their results for the summer have also topped analysts’ profit expectations, according to FactSet. Companies usually beat analysts’ estimates each quarter, but the pressure was high this time around because they needed to justify the big moves upward for their stock prices since April.Delivering bigger profits is one of the easier ways companies can quiet criticism that their stock prices have become too expensive. Companies have also generally been giving strong forecasts for upcoming results, according to Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian.
